            <span class="color-dark-2 under-line">Driver & Fleet Bookings:</span>
            Truck drivers and fleet managers can book parking spaces based on hourly, daily, weekly, or subscription
            (monthly) needs. The platform helps them choose spots based on proximity, duration, and cost. <br />
            <span class="color-dark-2 under-line">Admin Dashboard & Analytics:</span>
